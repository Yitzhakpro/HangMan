# HangMan
basic terminal HangMan game that I created

This is my first "Game" that i created,
All you need to do to play this game is to run the HangMan.py,
then it will ask for a text file location (I included one with 100 words) - each word in the text file needs to be in a line, alone.
after that it will ask for a index of the words u choose (0 to (amount of words - 1))

And thats it... enjoy the good old HangMan game!
